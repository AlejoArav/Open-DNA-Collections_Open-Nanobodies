Thank you for taking the time to file a feature request. To help with understanding if and how to prioritise this request, please provide as much of the following information as possible. 

### **Naming the Issue**
To help with pinpointing which of the Open DNA Collections that this feature request is for, please use these codes in the "Issue Title" as follows, before adding a short description of the proposed feature: 
- [OEC] = Open Enzyme Collection (parts in vector pOpen_v3). 
- [ORC] = Open Reporters Collection (parts in vector pOpen_v3). 
- [MDT] = Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit (ready-to-express constructs in vector pOpen_v3). 
- [RiDC] = Research in Diagnostics Collection (as MDT, but in vector pTI).
- [ePET] = E. coli Protein Expression Toolkit (parts in vector pOpen_v3).  
- [bPST] = Bacillus subtilis Protein Secretion Toolkit (parts in vector pOpen_v3). 
- [OYC] = Open Yeast Collection (parts in vector pOpen_v3). 
- [PURE] = PUREiodic Table Construction Kit (parts in pET28a). 
- [OP] = Open Plasmids. 
- [ODC] = Open DNA Collections - if the issue is related to all the above collections in general. 
e.g. [ODC] Create templates for Issues and Feature Requests to get as much information as possible to prioritise actions

### **Follow-Up Actions (Assignees, Labels)**
Each Feature Request will also be given a label to indicate what it refers to. For now, we are mainly using labels: sequence, part function, plasmid recovery, part proposal, enhancement, documentation. 

We welcome contributors to assign themselves to help with addressing these issues. Please let us know if you wish to do so. We're a small team, so any issues raised and support you can provide is greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for taking the time to fill out this Feature Request and for contributing to improving the Open DNA Collections!
