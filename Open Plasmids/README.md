# Open Plasmids

Currently, sharing and reuse of plasmids is managed by material transfer agreements and patent-based property rights.
Navigating these rights and agreements can place cumbersome legal burdens on researchers, who often do not have the legal training to negotiate the agreements themselves,
and who may not have access to a university technology transfer office who can help them through the process.

To address these challenges, we have made our own open source plasmids of known provenance and free of IP conflict,
thus removing property rights encumbrances and redistribution barriers. Here we present the Open Plasmids Collection, a growing group of standard,
freely available, open-source plasmids. Plasmids in the collection can be reused, remade, and redistributed as often as one would like.

### What can it be used for:

The Open Plasmids distribution is comprised of three plasmids: pBuild, pYeast, and pInducible. Each vector was designed specifically for the Open Plasmids Collection,
and has both an E. coli origin of replication and an antibiotic resistance marker for negative selection.

pBuild is designed as a robust, flexible E. coli cloning vector. The plasmid backbone is compatible with multiple cloning strategies,
including restriction ligation, Gibson assembly, SLiCE, and Golden Gate assembly using the FreeGenes MoClo standard. pYeast is an expression vector designed
for propagation in E. coli and galactose-inducible expression in yeast, allowing users to investigate their genes in a eukaryotic environment. pInducible is
an inducible-copy vector based on iGEM plasmid pSB2K3, and intended for cloning difficult or toxic genes.
