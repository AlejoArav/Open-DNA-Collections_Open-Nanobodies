# Open Reporters Collection

The Open Reporter Collection includes 32 commonly used reporter genes used in all kinds of biology labs for a variety of techniques including measuring gene expression,
diagnostics, verifying successful transformations and more. The collection includes chromoproteins (which produce a colour that is visible to the naked eye), fluorescent
proteins (that require excitation by a certain wavelength of light and emit another wavelength), luciferases (which emit bioluminscence) and other enzymes that enable
colorimetric detection of a substrate by changing its color, for example horseradish peroxidase which classically turns a chemical substrate bright pink in very common
antibody-based assays such as ELISA.

### What can the collection be used for?

There are so many uses for reporter genes that parts of this collection will be useful for almost any lab performing cell or molecular biology.
We have provided reporters with a variety of spectra, output and maturation times to cater for specific research uses.
Importantly, we cover a wide variety of colours that are visible to the naked eye and using fluorescent detection, making this collection useful 
not only for research but also for education and even bioart. All reporters are off-patent and can also be used commercially, which is good news
for small biotech companies.

Open Reporters are not provided in expression vectors. In order to see a color, you must subclone your gene of interest into an expression vector.
