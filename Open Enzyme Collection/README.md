# Open Enzyme Collection

The Open Enzyme Collection consists of 81 genes for enzymes that are "workhorses" of molecular biology, including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases,
DNA ligases, reverse transcriptases and restriction enzymes. The enzymes are useful in both basic and applied fields as diverse as genomics, diagnostics,
biodiversity, synthetic biology, DNA origami, immunology, biochemistry and more.

The foundational technologies enabled by this collection of include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning, isothermal amplification, reverse transcription
of RNA into DNA, and dNTP synthesis. Additionally, the Open Enzyme collection contains enzyme genes for fixing damaged and degraded DNA prior to amplification,
enzymes for cutting protein sequences to remove unwanted parts, and DNA-binding proteins that can be fused with other enzymes to improve functionality.

The Open Bioeconomy Lab designed and codon-optimized the Open Enzymes parts for expression in Escherichia coli bacteria.
All enzymes are obtained from expired patents or for various reasons are not encumbered by patent rights.

### What can the collection be used for?

Researchers can use the collection as the basis of manufacturing their own enzymes by cloning them into an expression vector of their choice and then
transforming into E. coli bacteria. This can help reduce lab costs and overcome supply chain issues, particularly in areas of the world where enzymes
are harder to obtain. The enzymes can also be used as a base to improve functionality or add new functions through genetic engineering and directed evolution.

Open Enzymes are not provided in expression vectors. In order to produce an enzyme, you must subclone your gene of interest into an expression vector.
Open Enzymes are also compatible with the ﻿E. coli ﻿ Protein Expression Toolkit (all parts have CE overhangs). More information about the collection can be
obtained from the Open Bioeconomy Lab.

This product is made available under the unilateral OpenMTA.

Some or all of these items are for use only as permitted by a research exemption.
