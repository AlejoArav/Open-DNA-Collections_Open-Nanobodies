# E.coli Protein Expression Toolkit

Are you looking for an all-in-one toolkit to build up your dream construct to try expressing your enzymes of choice, tailored to your labâ€™s resources and needs?
A toolkit containing different promoters, RBSs, linkers, tags, reporters? This collection might be for you.
A collection of >100 DNA parts designed to be assembled in one-pot reaction using BsaI-based Golden-Gate assembly.
DNA parts are MoClo, SEVA, Loop and CIDAR assembly compatible. The collection includes:

- 3 promoters 
- 7 RBS and insulators
- 9 purification tags, 3 localization signals
- 5 cleavage sites, flexible linkers
- 23 genes of which 5 are reporters and 18 are used in diagnostics
- 3 destination vectors

### What can it be used for:

Use the DNA parts of the collection to assemble the expression plasmids for the protein of your choice, tailored to the resources present in your lab.
The collection enables thousands of combinations for each gene of choice. Full power of the collection can be explored using pipetting robots.
The collection is compatible with all the CDSs present in the Open Enzyme collections.
