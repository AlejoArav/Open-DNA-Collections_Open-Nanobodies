# Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit

Enzymes are the heart of each and every diagnostic test. Enzymes are the means by which we can track, study and defeat old and new infectious diseases.
However, enzymes are globally distributed from centralized foundries and often require a cold chain to maintain function, restricting access.
Poor access to reagents is exacerbated in times of supply chain disruptions such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Open Bioeconomy Lab has developed the Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit to combat diagnostic enzyme access restrictions. The toolkit includes:

- IPTG inducible, T7 promoter driven ready-to-use expression cassettes to produce essential enzymes used in diagnostic among which RT, Bst-LF, RPA enzymes, RNA inhibitors.
Enzymes are His-tagged and cassettes design are based on literature and experimental evidence
- A set of constructs for the production of Sars-CoV-2 RNA positive and negative controls

### What can it be used for:

The collection wants to provide researchers worldwide with an open source toolkit to produce their own enzymes, streamlining their research in
diagnostics irrespective of supply chain disruptions.

The expression cassettes in this collection have been shown to work in literature. For distribution purposes we had to clone the newly synthesized
cassettes in a novel off-patent vector backbone. The expression from this new vector has not been validated yet.

This product is made available under the unilateral OpenMTA. 

The Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit is shipped as purified and dried down plasmid DNA stained with Cresol Red in one 96-well plate. Each well contains approximately 50 ng of DNA. Cresol Red will not impact plasmid transformation.

Some or all of these items are for use only as permitted by a research exemption.
