# Reclone Open DNA Collections

> A global collaboration for equitable access to biotechnology

The [Reclone Reagent Collaboration Network](https://reclone.org) has worked for the creation and disponibilization of open DNA collections. While these collections were originally distributed by [Freegenes](https://stanford.freegenes.org)
), now some parts of this project are separating into their own organization structure. The parts in this repository will receive a new ID, and this is where we will centralize the issues board for any changes proposed for the DNA or documentation on these collections.

Here you can find the genbank files and metadata, and SBOL objects for the plasmids in different collections:
